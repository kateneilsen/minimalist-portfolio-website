            This project required me to build a fully responsive landing page to
            the designs provided. I used HTML5, along with CSS Grid and
            JavaScript for the areas that required interactivity, such as the
            testimonial slider.

            This was a small project which mostly consisted of HTML and CSS. I
            built a fully-responsive landing page. The only JavaScript this
            project required was to enable the toggling of the mobile
            navigation.

            This project was built in pure HTML and CSS. I had mobile and
            desktop designs to work to and built it so that it was
            fully-responsive. I took a mobile-first approach and used modern CSS
            like Flexbox and Grid for layout purposes.
